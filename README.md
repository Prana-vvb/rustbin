## Functional Requirements (As per [System Design](https://systemdesign.one/system-design-pastebin))
- [x] ~Online text storage service similar to pastebin.com or GitHub gist~
- [x] ~A client (user) enters text data into the system known as a paste~
- [x] ~A paste must not be greater than 1 MB in size~
- [x] ~The system must return a unique paste ID for each Paste~
- [x] ~The client visiting the paste ID must be able to view the paste~
- [ ] ~The system must support only text-based data for a paste~ - WON'T IMPLEMENT
- [x] ~The paste ID should be readable~
- [x] ~The paste ID should be collision-free~
- [x] ~The paste ID should be non-predictable~
- [ ] The client should be able to choose a custom paste ID
- [ ] The paste ID should generate an analytics report (not real-time) such as the total number of access to a paste
- [ ] The client should be able to define the expiration time of the paste
- [ ] The client should be able to delete a paste
- [ ] The client must be able to set the visibility of the paste (public, private)
- [ ] The client must be able to set an optional password for the paste
- [ ] A paste must be filtered by Pastebin to prevent questionable content
